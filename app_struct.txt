1. First 92 bytes are 0x80 followed by 90 bytes 0x0
2. Each file are started with 55AA 5AA5
3. Then 4 bytes for Packet(header) Length
4. Then 4 bytes for 0x00000001
5. Then 8 bytes for Hardware ID (HWEW11.1)
6. Then 4 bytes for File Sequence (*?)
7. Then 4 bytes for Data file length 
8. Then 16 bytes for File Date (in yyyy.mm.dd format)
9. Then 16 bytes for File time (in hh:mm:ss format)
10.Then 8 bytes for PlatformModel (:BV7R2C0)
11.Then 16 bytes for FirmwareNumber (:21.302.01.00.55 for example)
12.Then 8 bytes blank (0x00000000)
13.Then 2 bytes for the Checksum of the header
14.Then 2 bytes for always 0x1000 ?
15.Then 2 bytes for Blank [step 2-16 consumes 98bytes)
16.Then ($headerLength-98) bytes for file checksum
17.Then data file length bytes for files.
18.Then padding if have
19.Then repeat 2 to 18
